# ns8-supervised-ml-lab

Reproducible supervised-learning benchmark on structured NS8 modular grids. Shows dataset generation, preprocessing with pipelines, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation for both classification and regression - built to be recruiter-friendly and leak-free.

## Project intent
- Keep NS8 math central (TRB/TLF kernels and derived transforms).
- Demonstrate scikit-learn fundamentals: pipelines, CV, tuning, clean splits, reproducible runs.
- Ship artifacts and summaries a recruiter can read quickly.

## Quickstart (Phase 0)
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
python -m pytest
```
Or with make:
```bash
make setup
make test
```

## Roadmap snapshot
- Phase 0: repo skeleton + basic formulas test (this commit).
- Phase 1: NS8 grid generator, features, dataset builder.
- Phase 2: supervised baselines + evaluation (classification and regression).
- Phase 3: hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking.
- Phase 4: polish, leakage guards, CLI, results and figures.

## Dataset generation (Phase 1 in progress)
```bash
python - <<'PY'
from ns8lab.data import build_dataset
df = build_dataset(task="task_a_view", n_samples=5, seed=0)
print(df.head())
PY
```

## Structure (Phase 1)
- README.md, LICENSE, pyproject.toml, .gitignore
- src/ns8lab/ - grids, feature extraction, dataset builder
- tests/ - unit tests for grids, features, dataset factory
- notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb - exploration placeholder
- data/ - raw and processed data (gitignored; keep small samples only)
- reports/figures/ - generated plots and artifacts

## Next steps
- Expand grid generator to all NS8 views (TRF/BLF/BRF/TLB/BLB/BRB) and vectorize.
- Build dataset maker and feature extraction.
- Add training and evaluation CLI with pipelines and tuning, saving runs and reports.
