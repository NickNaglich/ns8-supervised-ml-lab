## 2025-01-03 00:00 - Phase 0 - Project initialization

**Summary**  
Initialized the NS8 Supervised Learning Showcase project structure and defined agent execution rules. Established a phased workflow oriented around reproducible supervised-learning experiments using Naglich Squares datasets.

**Files changed**
- AGENT-RULES.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Before any implementation, the agent requires a clear, enforceable contract describing goals, scope, dataset definitions, evaluation standards, and deliverables. Adding a mandatory agent log ensures traceability across AI-driven development sessions.

**Validation**
- No code executed
- Structural and documentation-only change

**Notes**
- Future entries must be appended below this one
- All subsequent phases should reference this log when adding features or modifying behavior

## 2025-01-03 00:30 - Phase 0 - Repo skeleton and NS8 grid scaffold

**Summary**  
Started Phase 0 by cleaning the README, adding make targets, defining the initial NS8 grid generator scaffold, and adding placeholder assets for required directories. Added a minimal unit test to spot-check the canonical A_TLF/TRB grids.

**Files changed**
- README.md
- Makefile
- src/ns8lab/__init__.py
- src/ns8lab/grids.py
- tests/test_grids.py
- tests/__init__.py
- data/.gitkeep
- notebooks/.gitkeep
- reports/figures/.gitkeep

**Reasoning**  
Phase 0 calls for an instantly reviewable skeleton with a reproducible quickstart and a minimal NS8 correctness test. I defined a deterministic modular kernel and orientation transforms to unblock future phases and documented usage in the refreshed README and Makefile.

**Validation**
- Not run (sandboxed environment without dependencies installed)

**Notes**
- Grid formula: base kernel uses (row + k * col) mod N, 1-indexed; orientation bits map to vertical flip (T/B), horizontal flip (L/R), and transpose (F/B).

---

## 2025-01-03 01:00 - Phase 1 - Checklist created

**Summary**  
Added a detailed Phase 1 checklist to `PHASED-PLAN.md`, breaking down grid completion, task/label definitions, feature extraction, dataset factory, reproducibility wiring, and exploration notebook deliverables.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Creating explicit checkboxes for Phase 1 clarifies scope and sequencing for dataset generation and feature work, ensuring we can track progress against the acceptance criteria.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Checklist highlights determinism, full dihedral coverage, tidy dataset outputs, and notebook sanity checks.

---

## 2025-01-03 01:30 - Phase 1 - NS8 dataset generator and features

**Summary**  
Implemented Phase 1 core pieces: completed dihedral grid generation, added feature extraction (histograms, entropy/Gini, row/col stats, autocorr, symmetry, FFT energy), built a deterministic dataset factory for Tasks A/B/C with caching, and created an exploration notebook stub. Added tests for grids, features, and dataset creation; refreshed README and checklist to reflect progress.

**Files changed**
- src/ns8lab/grids.py
- src/ns8lab/features.py
- src/ns8lab/data.py
- src/ns8lab/__init__.py
- tests/test_grids.py
- tests/test_features.py
- tests/test_data.py
- notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb
- README.md
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Phase 1 requires a dataset factory built on deterministic NS8 grids with reproducible features and labeled tasks. The feature set covers the specified statistics, and the builder samples N/k/views with fixed seeds while supporting CSV/Parquet caching. Tests assert deterministic grids, feature correctness, and stable dataset generation.

**Validation**
- Not run (dependencies not installed in this sandbox)

**Notes**
- Run `make setup && make test` to validate locally.
- Parquet writing requires an engine like pyarrow; CSV works by default.

---

## 2025-01-03 02:00 - Phase 0/1 - Test suite executed

**Summary**  
Ran `python -m pytest` after installing dependencies; all 11 tests passed in 2.39s, validating grid generation, feature extraction, and dataset factory behavior.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Executing the test suite confirms Phase 0/1 scaffolding works end-to-end after resolving the pyproject BOM issue. Updated the Phase 0 checklist to mark tests as completed.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest` (11 passed)

**Notes**
- PATH warnings from pip are informational; no action required unless you want the scripts on PATH.

---

## 2025-01-03 02:15 - Phase 2 - Checklist created

**Summary**  
Added a Phase 2 checklist to `PHASED-PLAN.md` covering training pipelines for Tasks A/B/C, CV-based model selection, metrics/figures, entrypoints, run logging, and test extensions.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
The checklist makes Phase 2 scope explicit: pipelines with preprocessing, cross-validation, required models, logging to runs/reports, and evaluation outputs per contract.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Metrics to include: accuracy, macro F1, RMSE, R^2; figures for confusion matrix and CV/learning curves.

---

## 2025-01-03 02:45 - Phase 2 - Baseline training pipelines implemented

**Summary**  
Implemented Phase 2 baselines: training/evaluation module with pipelines for Tasks A/B/C (LogReg, LinearSVC, RF classifiers; Ridge, Lasso, RF regressor), CV-based model selection, metrics logging, confusion matrices, and artifact saving to `runs/` and `reports/`. Added evaluation utilities, CLI/script entrypoint, reports/results placeholder, README training instructions, and tests covering training artifacts.

**Files changed**
- src/ns8lab/train.py
- src/ns8lab/evaluate.py
- src/ns8lab/__init__.py
- scripts/train_baselines.py
- tests/test_train.py
- README.md
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- reports/results/.gitkeep
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Phase 2 requires leak-free pipelines with preprocessing in scikit-learn Pipelines, cross-validation for model selection, and artifact logging. Implemented deterministic training runs that save configs, metrics, CV results, trained models, and confusion matrices; summaries are written to reports for quick review.

**Validation**
- Existing test suite was not re-run after this change in this sandbox; previous run (11/11) passed. New tests added for training artifacts should be run locally with `python -m pytest`.

**Notes**
- Matplotlib is set to Agg to allow headless plotting. CV results are saved to CSV; confusion matrices are saved per run and mirrored into `reports/figures/`.

---

## 2025-01-03 03:05 - Phase 2 - Training robustness fixes

**Summary**  
Adjusted training to handle newer scikit-learn APIs and small-sample edge cases: removed the deprecated `multi_class` arg, added fallback for stratified splits when classes are too small, adapted CV splits based on class counts, and switched UTC timestamps to timezone-aware datetime. Verified the training test now passes.

**Files changed**
- src/ns8lab/train.py
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Pip installed scikit-learn 1.8 where `multi_class` is unsupported; also stratified splits/CV require at least 2 samples per class. The updates keep pipelines robust on small sampled datasets while preserving reproducibility.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest tests/test_train.py -q`

**Notes**
- Stratified CV is used when each class has at least 2 samples; otherwise KFold is used to avoid failures on sparse labels.

---

## 2025-01-03 03:20 - Phase 3 - Checklist created

**Summary**  
Added a Phase 3 checklist to `PHASED-PLAN.md`, outlining config-driven tuning (GridSearchCV), experiment tracking artifacts, CLI/script entrypoint, and required tests/artifacts placement.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
The checklist clarifies the tuning and experiment-tracking scope: central configs, artifacts in runs/reports/experiments, preprocessing inside pipelines, and tests for config loading and outputs.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Artifacts to include per run: config.yaml, metrics.json, cv_results.csv, model.joblib, figures, optional model_card.md.

---

## 2025-01-03 03:50 - Phase 3 - Tuning configs, CLI, and artifacts

**Summary**  
Implemented Phase 3 tuning workflow: added YAML configs for Tasks A/B/C, built a tuning module and CLI that load configs, run GridSearchCV (including SVM RBF, RF, Ridge), and log artifacts to both `runs/` and `reports/experiments/` with config, metrics, CV results, model, confusion matrices, and model cards. Added tests for tuning artifacts, updated README/plan, and included PyYAML dependency.

**Files changed**
- pyproject.toml
- configs/task_a.yaml
- configs/task_b.yaml
- configs/task_c.yaml
- src/ns8lab/tune.py
- src/ns8lab/train.py
- src/ns8lab/__init__.py
- scripts/tune.py
- tests/test_tune.py
- reports/experiments/.gitkeep
- README.md
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Phase 3 requires config-driven tuning with reproducible artifacts. The new CLI consumes YAML configs, runs CV with leak-free pipelines, and mirrors artifacts to both runs/ and reports/experiments/. Tests ensure configs load and outputs are written.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest` (13 passed, warning from sklearn penalty deprecation)

**Notes**
- Matplotlib set to Agg for headless plotting; confusion matrices copied to `reports/figures/`. PyYAML added as a dependency for config parsing.

---

## 2025-01-03 03:55 - Phase 3 - Cleaned logistic warnings and re-ran tests

**Summary**  
Removed the deprecated `penalty` argument from LogisticRegression in training/tuning pipelines to silence sklearn 1.8 warnings; re-ran the full test suite cleanly.

**Files changed**
- src/ns8lab/train.py
- src/ns8lab/tune.py
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Explicit `penalty` is deprecated in sklearn 1.8. Dropping it keeps configs future-proof and keeps test output clean.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest` (13 passed, no warnings)

**Notes**
- No behavioral change expected; defaults retain L2 penalty.

---

## 2025-01-03 04:05 - Phase 3 - Regression metric compatibility fix

**Summary**  
Adjusted regression RMSE computation to avoid the `squared=False` argument (not available in some sklearn builds); now compute RMSE via manual sqrt of MSE for compatibility. Verified tuning test still passes.

**Files changed**
- src/ns8lab/evaluate.py
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
User run of `scripts/tune.py` on task C failed because their sklearn build rejected `squared=False`. Manual RMSE keeps behavior consistent across versions.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest tests/test_tune.py -q`

**Notes**
- No change to metrics semantics; only avoids a version-specific kwarg.

---

## 2025-01-03 04:15 - Phase 4 - Checklist created

**Summary**  
Added a Phase 4 checklist to `PHASED-PLAN.md`, focusing on robustness/hardening, CLI polish, leakage guards, README results, and ensuring artifacts/tests cover multiple models per task.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
The checklist clarifies the final polish/robustness scope: pick a hardening feature (e.g., group splits), add minimal CLI, bolster tests, and document results/quickstart.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Deliverables include make targets for dataset/train/report and confirmed artifacts for multiple models per task.

---

## 2025-01-03 04:40 - Phase 4 - Group-aware splits, CLI, results summary

**Summary**  
Implemented Phase 4 hardening and polish: added group-aware splits by (N,k) to training/tuning, introduced a minimal CLI (`ns8lab.cli`) for dataset/train/tune, expanded Makefile targets, added leakage guard tests, and documented current single-seed results in README. Updated plan checklist and reran tests.

**Files changed**
- Makefile
- src/ns8lab/cli.py
- src/ns8lab/train.py
- src/ns8lab/tune.py
- src/ns8lab/evaluate.py
- tests/test_train.py
- tests/test_tune.py
- tests/test_splits.py
- README.md
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Group-aware splits reduce leakage risk by keeping (N,k) combinations out of both train and test. CLI and make targets improve usability. Tests ensure artifacts and group splitting work. README now reports current best metrics (single-seed) for transparency.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest` (14 passed)

**Notes**
- CLI commands: `python -m ns8lab.cli dataset|train|tune ...`. Group splitting can be disabled with `--no-group-split` on train if needed.
- Results are single-seed; rerun with new seeds for stability checks.

---

## 2025-01-03 04:55 - Phase 4 - Second-seed tuning runs and results update

**Summary**  
Ran additional tuning with seed=1 and larger samples via new config copies (`configs/task_*_seed1.yaml`). Task A metrics dropped (logreg best: acc 0.47/F1 0.43), Task B collapsed to 0.0 when grouping by (N,k), Task C remained strong (RF reg: RMSE ~0.0/R² ~1.0). Updated README results table to include both seeds and noted the grouping effect.

**Files changed**
- configs/task_a_seed1.yaml
- configs/task_b_seed1.yaml
- configs/task_c_seed1.yaml
- README.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Second-seed runs provide a stability check. The Task B drop highlights that grouping by (N,k) holds out k buckets entirely; this may need relaxed grouping (e.g., by N only) depending on desired generalization.

**Validation**
- Manual tuning runs: `python scripts/tune.py --config configs/task_a_seed1.yaml`, task_b_seed1.yaml, task_c_seed1.yaml

**Notes**
- Consider rerunning Task B without k-level grouping or with more samples to avoid zero-score collapse.

---

## 2025-01-03 05:05 - Phase 4 - Task B regrouping runs (no grouping)

**Summary**  
Reran Task B tuning with group splitting disabled (seeds 0 and 1). All models returned to accuracy/F1 1.00, confirming the earlier collapse was due to strict (N,k) grouping. Updated README results table to note grouped vs ungrouped outcomes.

**Files changed**
- README.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Grouping by (N,k) excluded k buckets from training; disabling grouping restored baseline performance. Documented both modes for clarity.

**Validation**
- `python scripts/tune.py --config configs/task_b.yaml` and `configs/task_b_seed1.yaml` with `group_split=False` (via inline call)

**Notes**
- Use grouping choice based on desired generalization (by N only vs across k). Current configs remain grouped; reruns without grouping are captured in reports/experiments/20251231_230644_* and 20251231_230703_*.

---

## 2025-01-03 05:20 - Phase 4 - Group-mode support and Task B group-N config

**Summary**  
Added configurable grouping modes (nk/n/none) for splits in training/tuning and CLI; introduced a recommended Task B config that groups by N only (`configs/task_b_groupN.yaml`). Updated tests and README results to reflect grouped vs. grouped-by-N outcomes.

**Files changed**
- src/ns8lab/train.py
- src/ns8lab/tune.py
- src/ns8lab/cli.py
- tests/test_train.py
- tests/test_tune.py
- tests/test_splits.py
- configs/task_b_groupN.yaml
- README.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Grouping by (N,k) can over-constrain Task B; adding group modes lets us choose leakage guard strength. Group-by-N preserves strong performance while avoiding size leakage; README now recommends the group-N config.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest` (14 passed)

**Notes**
- CLI flag `--group-mode nk|n|none` controls grouping. Task B defaults/recommendations are now clarified in README.

---

## 2025-01-03 05:25 - Phase 5 definition added

**Summary**  
Defined Phase 5 in `PHASED-PLAN.md` to capture final polish tasks: results table/reporting, README reproduction steps, aggregated model cards, optional stability checks, and final doc/CLI alignment.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
With Phase 4 complete, Phase 5 formalizes the remaining polish needed for a publish-ready handoff focusing on reproducibility and clear results communication.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Tasks include populating `reports/results/` with tables and aligning README with make/CLI usage.

---

## 2025-01-03 05:30 - Phase 5 checklist added

**Summary**  
Added an explicit Phase 5 checklist to `PHASED-PLAN.md` covering results table, reproduction steps in README, aggregated model cards, optional Task A stability run, and final doc/CLI alignment.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Clear checkboxes make the final polish tasks trackable and easy to close out for a publish-ready handoff.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Remaining work is largely documentation and a small optional run; codebase otherwise stable.

---

## 2025-01-03 05:45 - Phase 5 progress: results, reproduction, model cards

**Summary**  
Populated results artifacts and README for Phase 5: added tables to `reports/results/`, aggregated model cards, a reproducibility section in README, and ran the optional Task A group-mode-N stability check (logged as underperforming). Updated the Phase 5 checklist accordingly.

**Files changed**
- reports/results/results.md
- reports/results/model_cards.md
- README.md
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Final polish requires clear results and reproduction steps. Documented recommended configs (including Task B group-N), captured best metrics, and added aggregated model summaries for quick review.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest` not rerun after docs-only changes; last run was green (14 tests).

**Notes**
- Task A group-mode-N trial was weaker than group N,k; noted in README.

---

## 2025-01-03 05:55 - Phase 5 - Doc/CLI alignment

**Summary**  
Aligned README with CLI/make usage: added a CLI shortcuts section covering dataset/train/tune commands, noted group-mode choices (nk/n/none) with Task B recommendation, and confirmed make targets mirror the documented commands. Marked the final Phase 5 checklist item as done.

**Files changed**
- README.md
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Final polish requires instructions to match available commands and recommended grouping modes so users can reproduce results reliably.

**Validation**
- Not run (docs-only change)

**Notes**
- Task B recommended config remains `configs/task_b_groupN.yaml`; CLI `--group-mode n` mirrors that behavior.

---

## 2025-01-03 06:00 - Phase 6 defined (stability and defaults)

**Summary**  
Added Phase 6 to `PHASED-PLAN.md` to capture next-step improvements: stabilize Task A with more samples/features, set Task B defaults (group-N), pin core deps, add quick visuals in README, and align CLI defaults per task.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
With core phases done, Phase 6 lays out practical refinements for stability and usability without large rewrites.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Actions include feature tweaks, version pinning, and UX polish.

---

## 2025-01-03 06:05 - Phase 6 checklist added

**Summary**  
Added a Phase 6 checklist to `PHASED-PLAN.md` to track stability tweaks, default configs, dependency pinning, README visuals, and CLI default alignment.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Checkpoints make the refinement tasks actionable and measurable.

**Validation**
- Not run (documentation-only change)

**Notes**
- Pending: Task A feature/sampling changes, dep pinning, README visual snippet, CLI default adjustments.

---

## 2025-01-03 06:20 - Phase 6 progress: stability tweaks, defaults, pinning

**Summary**  
Completed Phase 6 items: added skew/kurtosis and FFT band ratio features and increased Task A sample sizes; pinned numpy/scikit-learn; set task-aware CLI group-mode defaults (B uses group-N); added README figures note; updated configs and tests; reran full test suite.

**Files changed**
- src/ns8lab/features.py
- src/ns8lab/cli.py
- configs/task_a.yaml
- configs/task_a_seed1.yaml
- pyproject.toml
- README.md
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- tests/test_features.py
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Feature tweaks and larger samples aim to stabilize Task A; pinning deps reduces API drift; group-mode defaults and README visuals improve UX. Task B default remains group-by-N.

**Validation**
- `python -m pytest` (14 passed)

**Notes**
- CLI now defaults to group-mode `n` for Task B and `nk` for others unless overridden.

---

## 2025-01-03 06:35 - Phase 6 tuning rerun and results refresh

**Summary**  
Reran Task A tuning with new features/sample sizes (configs task_a.yaml/seed1) and refreshed results: best now logreg acc 0.59/F1 0.51 (seed 0) and acc 0.44/F1 0.40 (seed 1). Updated results table and model cards accordingly.

**Files changed**
- README.md
- reports/results/results.md
- reports/results/model_cards.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Feature tweaks required updated metrics. Documented the latest runs and adjusted best-model callouts.

**Validation**
- `python -m ns8lab.cli tune --config configs/task_a.yaml`
- `python -m ns8lab.cli tune --config configs/task_a_seed1.yaml`

**Notes**
- Task A still shows seed sensitivity; further gains likely need richer features or more data.

---

## 2025-01-03 06:45 - UI plan added

**Summary**  
Added `UI-PHASE.md` outlining a phased Streamlit UI plan: artifact browser, gated run controls, embedded docs/model cards, figures gallery, and production polish with configs and safety defaults.

**Files changed**
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Provides a roadmap for a lightweight UI to browse results, explain the repo, and optionally trigger runs/tests with guardrails.

**Validation**
- Not run (docs-only change)

**Notes**
- UI defaults to read-only with optional gated run mode; Streamlit suggested.

---

## 2025-01-03 06:50 - UI Phase 0 checklist added

**Summary**  
Added a checklist for UI Phase 0 to establish scope, run-mode gating, initial scaffolding (`ui/app.py`, utils/config stubs), and UI dependency handling.

**Files changed**
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Checkpoints clarify the initial UI setup tasks before building features.

**Validation**
- Not run (docs-only change)

**Notes**
- Defaults to read-only; run-mode gating still to be decided in implementation.

---

## 2025-01-03 07:00 - UI Phase 0 scaffolding

**Summary**  
Started UI Phase 0: added Streamlit skeleton (`ui/app.py`), utility stubs (`ui/utils.py`), UI config placeholder, and a UI requirements file. Marked relevant UI-0 checklist items done.

**Files changed**
- ui/app.py
- ui/utils.py
- ui/config.yaml
- requirements-ui.txt
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Provides a minimal, read-only scaffold with sections for intro, tasks, results snapshot, and recent runs; utilities/configs set paths/mode; dependencies isolated.

**Validation**
- Not run (UI not executed)

**Notes**
- Run-mode gating and persona confirmation remain to-do; app is read-only scaffold.

---

## 2025-01-03 07:15 - UI Phase 0 completed

**Summary**  
Finished UI-0 setup: confirmed persona/scope, set default read-only mode with gating via `ui/config.yaml` (`mode: read-only/run`), and marked checklist items done. Scaffold remains read-only until run controls are added in later phases.

**Files changed**
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Documented the gating approach and closed UI-0 so we can move to UI-1 artifact browsing.

**Validation**
- Not run (docs-only change)

**Notes**
- Current UI uses `mode` from `ui/config.yaml`; run controls not yet implemented.

---

## 2025-01-03 07:25 - UI Phase 1 in progress (artifact browser basics)

**Summary**  
Started UI-1 by wiring the results snapshot parser and enriching recent runs loading (metrics/config paths/figures). UI now shows results tables when present and richer run info in expanders.

**Files changed**
- ui/utils.py
- ui/app.py
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Phase 1 requires artifact browsing; parsing the results table and showing run details is the first step.

**Validation**
- Not run (UI not re-launched in this step)

**Notes**
- Filters/sorting and graceful handling for missing artifacts still to do in UI-1.

---

## 2025-01-03 07:35 - UI Phase 1 progress: filters and run details

**Summary**  
Added task filters to results and runs sections, improved run details (config path/text, figure thumbnails), and updated the UI-1 checklist accordingly.

**Files changed**
- ui/app.py
- ui/utils.py
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Filters and richer metadata make the artifact browser more usable and aligned with UI-1 goals.

**Validation**
- Not run (UI not relaunched in this step)

**Notes**
- Remaining UI-1 item: handle missing artifacts gracefully.

---

## 2025-01-03 07:55 - UI Phase 2 progress (gated run controls)

**Summary**  
Implemented gated run controls: added a run-mode panel that lists configs, shows a dry-run command, and can execute tune/tests when mode is set to `run`. Updated UI-1/2 checklists accordingly and enriched results/runs filters.

**Files changed**
- ui/app.py
- ui/utils.py
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Phase 2 requires optional run capabilities with gating; the panel remains inactive in read-only mode and exposes commands when enabled.

**Validation**
- Not run (UI not relaunched here)

**Notes**
- Still need confirmations/warnings and grouping-default messaging; missing-artifact handling also remains for UI-1.

---

## 2025-01-03 08:05 - UI Phase 2 continued: confirmations and notices

**Summary**  
Added confirmations/warnings to the run panel, noted Task B grouping preference, handled missing artifacts with captions, and marked UI-1/2 checklist items accordingly.

Files changed:
- ui/app.py
- ui/utils.py
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

Reasoning:
- Safeguards and clearer messaging reduce accidental runs; handling missing artifacts improves UX when data is absent.

Validation:
- Not rerun (UI not relaunched here)

Notes:
- Remaining UI-2 item: enforce grouping-default messaging/behavior; current warning mentions Task B group-N.

---

## 2025-01-03 08:15 - UI Phase 2: grouping reminder in run panel

**Summary**  
Added a Task B grouping reminder in the run panel when non-groupN configs are selected and completed the UI-2 checklist.

**Files changed**
- ui/app.py
- UI-PHASE.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
Ensures users see the group-N recommendation for Task B before triggering runs.

**Validation**
- Not rerun (UI not relaunched here)

**Notes**
- UI-1 and UI-2 are now complete; UI-3 is next.

---

## 2025-01-03 08:30 - UI Phase 3 progress: docs and figures

**Summary**

## 2025-01-03 15:05 - WB-OPT6 progress (figure gating)

**Summary**  
Gated figures in mobile card mode behind an expander to lazy-load heavy images, keeping pagination intact. Updated WB-OPT6 checklist accordingly.

**Files changed**  
- ui/app.py  
- WB-OPT.md  

**Reasoning**  
Reduces load and scroll on small screens by deferring image rendering until the user expands it.

**Validation**  
- UI not rerun here; display-only change.

**Notes**  
- Remaining WB-OPT6 item: filter debounce (dataset caching already in place).

---

## 2025-01-03 15:20 - WB-OPT6 completed (filter apply)

**Summary**  
Added an explicit “Apply filters” button to Results Browser to avoid recomputing on every selection, completing the WB-OPT6 items (mobile pagination, figure gating, filter debounce). Updated the WB-OPT checklist.

**Files changed**  
- ui/app.py  
- WB-OPT.md  

**Reasoning**  
Reduces unnecessary recompute/load when adjusting filters, aligning with the performance/media handling goals.

**Validation**  
- UI not rerun here; behavior change is minor and UI-only.

**Notes**  
- WB-OPT6 is now fully addressed.

## 2025-01-03 15:35 - WB-OPT fix: filter container context

**Summary**  
Fixed a crash in Results Browser by replacing the non-context-manager fallback with `nullcontext()` when not using an expander. The filter container now works for non-mobile layouts without TypeError.

**Files changed**  
- ui/app.py  

**Reasoning**  
Using the module `st` as a context manager caused a TypeError; `nullcontext()` provides a safe no-op context.

**Validation**  
- Not rerun here; should eliminate the reported TypeError on loading the Results Browser.

**Notes**  
- Filter expander still used on mobile; other layouts use the no-op context.

---

## 2025-01-03 15:55 - UI narrative plan added (UI-INFO)

**Summary**  
Captured a phased plan in `UI-INFO.md` to weave the project’s narrative into the UI via lean overview cards, contextual tooltips, page tips, and README links without adding heavy text.

**Files changed**  
- UI-INFO.md  

**Reasoning**  
Aligns the UI with the project’s “transparent, engineered-feature NS8 lab” framing while keeping the interface concise and device-friendly.

**Validation**  
- Docs-only addition.

**Notes**  
- Next steps: implement INFO phases to add concise tips/tooltips and overview cards.

---

## 2025-01-03 16:05 - INFO-1 overview cards added

**Summary**  
Added concise “What you’re seeing” cards to the Overview page, capturing the NS8 engineered-feature focus, task intent (A invariance, B leakage test, C scale sanity), and the read-only artifact-browsing purpose. Updated UI-INFO to mark INFO-1 complete.

**Files changed**  
- ui/app.py  
- UI-INFO.md  

**Reasoning**  
Surfaces the project’s intent inline without heavy text, aligning the UI with the narrative.

**Validation**  
- UI not rerun here; display-only change.

**Notes**  
- Next INFO phases can add contextual tooltips and per-page tip bars.

---

## 2025-01-03 16:20 - INFO-2 completed (contextual cues)

**Summary**  
Added concise contextual cues: Results Browser now notes Task B collapse under strict splits and reminds to hover artifacts; Run Details and card view mention engineered features (no raw grids); Compare highlights dataset signature implications; Dataset Explorer explains feature reduction. INFO-2 checklist marked done.

**Files changed**  
- ui/app.py  
- UI-INFO.md  

**Reasoning**  
Helps users quickly grasp intent and constraints without adding heavy text.

**Validation**  
- UI not rerun here; display-only additions.

**Notes**  
- Next: INFO-3 tip bars if desired.

---

## 2025-01-03 16:35 - INFO-3 completed (quick tips)

**Summary**  
Added concise “Quick tips” expanders to Results Browser, Run Details, Compare, and Dataset Explorer, summarizing the narrative: focus on artifacts over scores, Task B grouping behavior, engineered features (no raw grids), dataset signatures, and why grids are reduced to summaries. INFO-3 checklist marked done.

**Files changed**  
- ui/app.py  
- UI-INFO.md  

**Reasoning**  
Provides lightweight guidance inline without heavy text, adapted per page and device (expanders default closed on desktop).

**Validation**  
- UI not rerun here; display-only additions.

**Notes**  
- Remaining: INFO-4 (read-more links) and INFO-5 final consistency pass.

---

## 2025-01-03 16:45 - INFO-4 completed (read-more link in overview)

**Summary**  
Added a concise “Learn more” line to the Overview cards pointing users to README/model cards via the Docs tab; INFO-4 checklist updated.

**Files changed**  
- ui/app.py  
- UI-INFO.md  

**Reasoning**  
Keeps the UI lean while providing a clear path to deeper docs.

**Validation**  
- UI not rerun here; small text addition only.

**Notes**  
- INFO-5 remains for final consistency review.

## 2025-01-03 17:00 - README refresh plan started (R-0)

**Summary**  
Started the README refresh plan (FIX-README): audited pain points and defined the target shape (concise overview, quickstart, tasks-at-a-glance, UI usage, artifacts, structure, results table, cleanup note).

**Files changed**  
- FIX-README.md  

**Reasoning**  
Sets the roadmap for a more user-friendly README without recruiter-specific phrasing.

**Validation**  
- Docs-only change.

**Notes**  
- Next: outline and rewrite sections per plan.

## 2025-01-03 16:55 - Figures tab enhanced

**Summary**  
Expanded the Figures tab to allow source selection (reports/figures, reports/experiments, runs), recursive loading, name filtering, and a max-figure limit. Updated utils to support multi-dir/recursive figure loading.

**Files changed**  
- ui/utils.py  
- ui/app.py  

**Reasoning**  
Makes it easier to browse more figures (e.g., run-specific confusion matrices) while keeping the view manageable with filters and limits.

**Validation**  
- Not rerun here; UI-only change.

**Notes**  
- Defaults include reports/figures and experiments; runs can be toggled on as needed.
## 2025-01-03 14:40 - WB-OPT5 progress (UX polish applied)

**Summary**  
Implemented UX polish items: sidebar density toggle influences padding/font per device, filters/dataset path persist via session_state, mobile filters in an expander, optional figures toggle in card mode, and a “Back to top” anchor. Updated WB-OPT5 checklist to mark items done.

**Files changed**  
- ui/utils.py  
- ui/app.py  
- WB-OPT.md  

**Reasoning**  
Improves usability across devices by letting users pick density, keeping filters/path remembered, reducing scroll friction, and providing navigation anchors.

**Validation**  
- UI not rerun here; display-only/session-state changes.

**Notes**  
- Tap targets benefit from density; further tweaks can be added if needed.
## 2025-01-03 00:45 - Phase 0 - Checklist created and tracked

**Summary**  
Added an explicit Phase 0 checklist to `PHASED-PLAN.md` marking completed scaffolding and listing remaining actions (run tests, finalize README examples). This keeps scope visible while continuing the phase.

**Files changed**
- PHASED-PLAN.md
- AGENT-LOG.md

**Reasoning**  
The plan now includes a concise, reviewable set of checkboxes so we can verify Phase 0 completion at a glance and align remaining tasks with the acceptance criteria.

**Validation**
- Not run (no commands executed)

**Notes**
- Pending: execute `make test` once dependencies are installed; add README usage snippets after core APIs stabilize.
